# Analyzing Twitter Communities

This project uses the Twitter API to create a social network crawler. The crawler will create a network of reciprocal friends 
(defined as users who follow each other) until a hundred users are added to the network, or a maximum depth of 5 is reached. 
This project was done in Python 3.7 using the Twitter API, networkx, and matplotlib.

## Getting Started
Install the required libraries in `requirements.txt` using pip. Run `homework2.py`.
